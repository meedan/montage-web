/*
 * This file contains lists of groups of elements which need to have their
 * z-index order maintained. Items need to appear in these lists in a specific
 * order. Items which should have a higher z-index should be placed further
 * towards the end (right hand side) of the list.
 *
 * Currently, there is only a single grouping called layers. The `layers` group
 * represents main sections of the layout.
 *
 * Additional variables can be defined to maintain the z-order of a subgroup of
 * items. Just add the extra variable list below and use the `z` function to
 * include the correct z-index.
