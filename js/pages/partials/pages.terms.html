  <p>We’ve made the below Terms of Service available under a Creative Commons Sharealike license, which means you’re more than welcome to repurpose it for your own use.  We borrowed them from the very kind folks at Automattic and WordPress.com.</p>

<h2>Terms of Service:</h2>

<h3>Who we are.</h3>

<p>We are Storyful Limited (“Storyful”), incorporated and registered in Ireland with company number 478477 whose registered office is at 76 Lower Baggot Street, Dublin 2, Ireland.  The term we, our or us refers to Storyful and any other member of its group.</p>

<h3>General</h3>
<p>The following terms and conditions govern all use of the Storyful Montage application.  Our services (“Services”) are offered subject to your acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies (including, without limitation, Storyful’s Privacy Policy) and procedures that may be published from time to time by Storyful (collectively, the “Agreement”).  You agree that we may automatically upgrade our Services, and these terms will apply to any upgrades.</p>

<p>Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing or using our Services.  By accessing or using any part of our Services, you agree to become bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement.  If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this agreement, then you may not access or use any of our Services.</p>

<p>Use of our Services requires a Google account.  You agree to provide us with complete and accurate information when you register with us for the Services.  You will be solely responsible and liable for any activity that occurs under your username.  You are responsible for keeping your password secure.  Google accounts are provided by Google, and your use of a Google account is subject to Google’s Terms of Use for the services, which you’ll accept prior to using a Google account for the first time.  Storyful makes no warranties about the services provided by Google, and disclaims Google’s liability for any damages arising from our distribution and resale of their services.</p>

<h3>Responsibility of Contributors.</h3>

<p>If you create projects, collections, tags, comments on videos, or communicate with users through messages on Montage, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available (any such material, “Content”), you are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content or your conduct.  By using Montage, you represent and warrant that your Content and conduct do not violate these terms.  You understand that other people who are invited to collaborate on the project, either by yourself or other users will be able to see, modify and delete this Content.</p>

<p>If you delete Content, Storyful will use reasonable efforts to remove it from Montage, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable.  Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, Storyful has the right (though not the obligation) to, in Storyful’s sole discretion, (i) refuse or remove any Content that, in Storyful’s reasonable opinion, violates any Storyful policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (ii) terminate or deny access to and use of Montage to any individual or entity for any reason.</p>

<h3>Responsibility of Visitors.</h3>

<p>Storyful has not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, posted to our Services, and cannot therefore be responsible for that material’s content, use or effects.  By operating our Services, Storyful does not represent or imply that it endorses the material there posted, or that it believes such material to be accurate, useful, or non-harmful.  You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content.  Our Services may contain content that is offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable, as well as content containing technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, and other errors.  Our Services may also contain material that violates the privacy or publicity rights, or infringes the intellectual property and other proprietary rights, of third parties, or the downloading, copying or use of which is subject to additional terms and conditions, stated or unstated.  Storyful disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from the use by visitors of our Services, or from any downloading by those visitors of content there posted.</p>

<h3>Content Posted on Other Websites and Platforms.</h3>

<p>We have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including YouTube videos, made available through the Services.</p>

<p>Storyful does not have any control over those non-Storyful websites and content, and is not responsible for their contents or their use.  Storyful does not represent or imply that it endorses or has verified such content.  You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content.  Storyful disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from accessing content and videos through Montage.</p>

<h3>Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy.</h3>

<p>As Storyful asks others to respect its intellectual property rights, it respects the intellectual property rights of others.  If you believe that material linked to by Montage violates your copyright or any other rights, you are encouraged to notify the platform hosting the material (YouTube) and/or us as per their DMCA policy.  Storyful will terminate a visitor’s access to and use of the Website if, under appropriate circumstances, the visitor is determined to be a repeat infringer of the copyrights, intellectual property rights, or other rights, of Storyful or others.  Where appropriate, Storyful may also remove Content without any admission of liability.</p>

<h3>Intellectual Property.</h3>
<p>This Agreement does not transfer from Storyful to you any Storyful or third party intellectual property, and all right, title, and interest in and to such property will remain (as between the parties) solely with Storyful.  Your use of our Services grants you no right or license to reproduce or otherwise use any Storyful or third-party trademarks.</p>

<h3>Changes.</h3>
<p>We are constantly updating our Services, and that means sometimes we have to change the legal terms under which our Services are offered.  If we make changes that are material, we will let you know by posting on one of our blogs, or by sending you an email or other communication before the changes take effect.  The notice will designate a reasonable period of time after which the new terms will take effect.  If you disagree with our changes, then you should stop using our Services within the designated notice period.  Your continued use of our Services will be subject to the new terms.  However, any dispute that arose before the changes shall be governed by the Terms that were in place when the dispute arose.</p>

<h3>Termination.</h3>
<p>Storyful may terminate your access to all or any part of our Services at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately.  If you wish to terminate this Agreement or your Montage account (if you have one), you may simply discontinue using our Services.  All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>

<h3>Disclaimer of Warranties.</h3>
<p>Our Services are provided “as is”.  Storyful and its suppliers and licensors hereby disclaim all warranties of any kind, express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.

If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect.  A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof.  You may assign your rights under this Agreement to any party that consents to, and agrees to be bound by, its terms and conditions; Storyful may assign its rights under this Agreement without condition.  This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>
