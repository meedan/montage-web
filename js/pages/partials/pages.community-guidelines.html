<h2 class="h3 is-animated" style="transition-delay: 0.75s;">Introduction</h2>

</ul>
<h2 class="h3 is-animated" style="transition-delay: 0.6s;">Information you provide about third parties</h2>
<p style="transition-delay: 0.75s;">Where your content contains the images of others, we may ask you to provide us with the details of your relationship with those individuals.  We will only use those details to provide a description of your content, for verification purposes, or otherwise pursuant to terms agreed with you.

<h2 class="h3 is-animated" style="transition-delay: 0.9s;">Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
<p style="transition-delay: 1.05s;">When you visit the Site, we may automatically collect additional information about you, such as the type of internet browser you use, any website from which you have come to the Site and your IP address (the unique address which identifies your computer on the internet) which is automatically recognised by our web server.  You cannot be identified from this information and it is only used to assist us in providing an effective service on the Site and to collect broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>
<h2 class="h3 is-animated" style="transition-delay: 0s;">Cookies</h2>
<p style="transition-delay: 0s;">When you interact with the Site, we try to make that experience simple and meaningful.  When you visit the Site, our web server sends a cookie to your computer.  Cookies are small pieces of information which are issued to your computer when you visit a website and which store and sometimes track information about your use of the Site.  For example, cookies are used to personalise web search engines and to store shopping lists of items a user has selected while browsing through a virtual shopping mall.  A number of cookies we use last only for the duration of your web session and expire when you close your browser.  Other cookies are used to remember you when you return to the Site and will last for longer.</p>
<p style="transition-delay: 0.15s;">We use cookies to:</p>
<ul style="transition-delay: 0.3s;">
<li>remember that you have visited us before; this means we can identify the number of unique visitors we receive.  This allows us to make sure we have enough capacity for the number of users that we get;</li>
<li>customise elements of the promotional layout and/or content of the pages of the Site;</li>
<li>collect anonymous statistical information about how you use the Site (including how long you spend on the Site) and where you have come to the Site from, so that we can improve the Site and learn which parts of the Site are most popular with visitors; and</li>
<li>to speed site navigation and recognise your access rights on the site.</li>

<h2 class="h3 is-animated" style="transition-delay: 0.3s;">Child safety</h2>
<p style="transition-delay: 0.45s;">Protecting the safety of children when they use the Internet is very important to us.  We do not knowingly collect information from minors without seeking parental or guardian consent.  We recommend that children receive permission from their parent or guardian before gaining access to the Site or sending personal information to us or anyone else online.  Where we become aware that content may have been uploaded by a minor, we will contact the uploader to seek further permissions before using the content further.  If content provided by you contains children, you must seek parental or guardian consent to share the video with us.  When you submit the video, you declare that you have such permissions.</p>
<h2 class="h3 is-animated" style="transition-delay: 0s;">External links</h2>
<p style="transition-delay: 0.15s;">The Site may, from time to time, contain links to external sites.  We are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of such sites.</p>
<h2 class="h3 is-animated" style="transition-delay: 0.3s;">Payment processing</h2>
<p style="transition-delay: 0.45s;">Payment details you provide will be encrypted using secure sockets layer (SSL) technology before they are submitted to us over the internet.  Payments made on the Site are made through our payment gateway provider, PayPal.  You will be providing credit or debit card information directly to PayPal which operates a secure server to process payment details, encrypting your credit/debit card information and authorising payment.  Information which you supply to PayPal is not within our control and is subject to PayPal’s own privacy policy and terms and conditions.</p>
<h2 class="h3 is-animated" style="transition-delay: 0.6s;">Security</h2>
<p style="transition-delay: 0.75s;">We place great importance on the security of all personally identifiable information associated with our users.  We have security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of personal information under our control.  For example, our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorised personnel have access to personal information.  Whilst we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of information will never occur, we use all reasonable efforts to prevent it.</p>
<p style="transition-delay: 0.9s;">You should bear in mind that submission of information over the internet is never entirely secure.  We cannot guarantee the security of information you submit via the Site whilst it is in transit over the internet and any such submission is at your own risk.<br>
It is advisable to close your browser when you have finished your user session to help ensure others do not access your personal information if you use a shared computer or a computer in a public place.</p>

<p style="transition-delay: 0.15s;">Information that you submit via the Site is sent to and stored on secure servers located in the United States and in the EEA.  Information submitted by you may also be transferred by us to our other offices and/or to the third parties mentioned in the circumstances described above (see Information sharing), which may be situated outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and may be processed by staff operating outside the EEA.  The countries concerned may not have similar data protection laws to the EEA.  Where we transfer your information we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected.  By submitting information via the Site, you agree to this storing, processing and/or transfer.</p>
<h2 class="h3 is-animated" style="transition-delay: 0s;">Data transfers</h2>
<p style="transition-delay: 0.15s;">When you complete our registration forms or use our services, we may transfer your information to processors outside the European Economic Area but will do so with appropriate measures and controls in place to protect that information in accordance with applicable data protection legislation.<br>
When you give us information about another person, you confirm that they have appointed you to act for them and agreed to the transfer of their information abroad.</p>
<h2 class="h3 is-animated" style="transition-delay: 0s;">Your rights</h2>
<p style="transition-delay: 0.15s;">You have a legal right under the Irish Data Protection Act 1988 as amended by the Data Protection (Amendment) Act 2003 to a copy of all the personal information about you held by us.  On request, we will provide you with a copy of this information subject to a fee not exceeding  the permitted statutory maximum.  You also have a right to correct any errors in that information.
